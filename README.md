Angular app for a bar's employees and patrons to track the keg quantities and properties.

## Description

_This application allows patrons to see a list/menu of all available kegs (name, brand, price and alcoholContent). Keg prices are color-coded for easy readability and user may view beers by alcohol content - stronger to weaker. This application allows employees to add kegs to the list, edit a keg's properties, click button decrease the number of pints left by 1 with each purchase, and see kegs with less than 10 pints left (to anticipate a keg change). All users can see how many pints are left in a keg._
